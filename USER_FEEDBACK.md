Feedback for the authoring environment:

 - authoring environment needs to be able to update the objects in the background.
 - items in the accordion in the inventory pane should have an add object button, instead of having it in the inventory. 
 - Editor panes need some sort of "real time" view that shows how something will look like in the actual game. For example, in the dialogue cut scene editor, there needs to be a screen on the side that shows the positions of the head images and the dialog box.
 - We need to implement a way to change the editor panes.
 - Items in the InventoryPane should have an image associated with them.
 - Some text on buttons are poorly titled and should be more accurate.
