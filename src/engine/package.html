	<h1>Game Engine Package</h1>
  The Game Engine is the part of the project that is responsible for running the game, which includes A) interpreting and initializing the Game based on a previously published XML file, and B) Gameplay data specific to one player, such as moving and updating sprites, tracking data (ex. money, enemy, tower information), and handling basic user interaction with the Game Player. This portion of the project will demand the most complex and hierarchical design, and the design decisions made here will dictate the workflow of much of the project as a whole.
